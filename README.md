# How to run:
1. Install Pillow and pygame through your terminal by using pip.
2. On the terminal, open the 'checkers' folder
3. Run the 'checkers_game.py' file with python3 and you will be good to go!

# What the different files are:
* piece.py : this is class definition for a piece object!
* checker_board.py : our game board definition and logic for the game
* checker_game.py : the actually setup and running of the game!

# Quick notes of this verison:
* In this game of checkers, only single jump is enabled. Use this to your advantage!
* The user (you) will start first. To make a move, select the piece you want to move and click on the place you want it to go
* The teminal will keep track of who's turn it is and who wins
* The game is over when there are no moves possible for one player or a player loses all their pieces

Have fun, and enjoy!
